These drugs were donated or subsidised by pharmaceutical companies GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, Pfizer and Merck Serono. The programme also provided vaccinations, bed-nets, and micronutrients in addition to the NTD treatments.</p>\n<p>The second concept was to scale up a national-level programme, integrating all the various NTD providers and equipping government to coordinate this national MDA programme.</p>\n<p>In addition to treating multiple diseases simultaneously in people with co-infections, the initiative raised awareness, educated people about NTDs, provided training, equipped health workers and mobilised local communities.</p>"},{"id":"11375","typeHandle":"text","heading":"Analysis","text":"<p>The success of these programmes was down to the collaboration\nbetween private philanthropy and government-led nationwide initiatives to\nadminister the required biannual MDAs.</p>\n<p>The\nprogrammeâ€™s integrated nature, along with the fact that it educated communities\nabout the importance of sanitation and hygiene, made it impactful and\nsustainable.</p>\n<p>In\nBurundi, the governmentâ€™s involvement caused a domino effect, resulting in\nmatch-funding from partners from all over the world.</p>\n<p>These\ninitiatives reinforced the importance of building strong strategic\npartnerships. Through collaboration, the NTD programme was able to more\nefficiently use resources, save on logistical costs and, most importantly,\nreach many people. </p>\n<p>After several years of successes, these two initiatives were eventually scaled up to become <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/portfolio/the-end-fund/\">The END Fund</a>, Legatumâ€™s leading philanthropic investment in health.
