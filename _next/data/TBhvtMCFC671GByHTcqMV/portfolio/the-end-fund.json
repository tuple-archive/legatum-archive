Investors who support the programme include Alwaleed Philanthropies, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Campbell Family Foundation, Children's Investment Fund Foundation, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Delta Philanthropies, Dubai Cares, ELMA Philanthropies, Good Ventures, Leona M. and Harry. B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies, Virgin Unite, and the Wyss Medical Foundation. The END Fund has been selected annually as a Givewell Top Charity from 2016-2020.</p>\n<p>The END Fund acts as both an innovator and a connector: co-creating programmes with local organisations in order to provide a long-term, sustainable approach to the treatment of these diseases, and collaborating with government, NGOs, pharmaceutical and academic partners to maximise the impact.</p>\n<p>The END Fund's approach involves identifying areas where there is an opportunity to make a real difference to people’s lives, and then working together with the best partners to achieve its goals.</p>\n<p>One such example is the \"Reaching the Last Mile Fund,\" a global partnership between philanthropists, governments and NGOs which aims to eliminate river blindness and lymphatic filariasis in seven countries across the Sahel and in Yemen. Another is the Deworming Innovation Fund, an ambitious partnership selected as a 2019 TED Audacious Project to eliminate intestinal worms and schistosomiasis in Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda and Zimbabwe.</p>\n<p>The organisation supports programmes in almost 30 countries, across Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. </p>"},{"id":"1301","typeHandle":"images","images":[{"id":"2807","kind":"image","url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/www-assets.legatum.com/assets/portfolio/Legatum-END_Fund-C03.jpg","title":"Legatum END Fund C03","width":1920,"height":1920,"focalPoint":[0.5,0.5],"imageCaption":"<p>A man holds out his hand to show the tablets that cure his community of Neglected Tropical Diseases, Burundi 2010</p>","extension":"jpg","mimeType":"image/jpeg","assetLottieRatio":null},{"id":"2808","kind":"image","url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/www-assets.legatum.com/assets/portfolio/Legatum-END_Fund-C04.jpg","title":"Legatum END Fund C04","width":1920,"height":1920,"focalPoint":[0.5,0.5],"imageCaption":"<p>Children line up to participate in a mass drug administration</p>","extension":"jpg","mimeType":"image/jpeg","assetLottieRatio":null}]},{"id":"1278","typeHandle":"text","heading":"Analysis","text":"<p>We entered the sector at a time when the term ‘neglected tropical diseases’ had just been coined, so-named for good reason – the hundreds of millions of people with these diseases had largely been forgotten by wealthier nations, despite the existence of cheap, effective treatments.
