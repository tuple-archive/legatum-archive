The results from Legatum's programmes indicated that an NTD grant was one of the most high-impact public health interventions. With so little attention on the issue, Legatum decided to seed a new private initiative that would focus exclusively on NTDs and seek to mobilise further resources and advocate for more public funds to be directed towards the disease set. </p>\n<p>At the beginning of 2012, the END Fund was born.</p>\n<p>On 30<sup>th</sup> January 2021, we celebrate World NTD Day, a new milestone in the fight to control and eliminate NTDs.
