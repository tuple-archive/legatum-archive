The programme had a goal to reach over 32,000 children in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger with an accelerated learning programme that covered the first three years of schooling in just ten months.</p>\n<p>After the successful trials in West Africa, the model was tested for its transportability and scalability in Ethiopia, where it was further developed to incorporate three languages.</p>\n<p>After seeing the concept proven twice, the programme was ready to be scaled up. In 2016, building on the learnings from Legatum’s previous collaborative donor vehicles (the END Fund and the Freedom Fund), the Luminos Fund was launched. Caitlin Baron, bringing ten years of experience as a director at the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, was appointed as CEO to lead the organisation towards its goal of helping six million children.</p>"},{"id":"3695","typeHandle":"images","images":[{"id":"2816","kind":"image","url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/www-assets.legatum.com/assets/portfolio/Legatum-Luminos_Fund-C01.jpg","title":"Legatum Luminos Fund C01","width":1920,"height":1920,"focalPoint":[0.5,0.5],"imageCaption":null,"extension":"jpg","mimeType":"image/jpeg","assetLottieRatio":null},{"id":"2817","kind":"image","url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/www-assets.legatum.com/assets/portfolio/Legatum-Luminos_Fund-C02.jpg","title":"Legatum Luminos Fund C02","width":1920,"height":1920,"focalPoint":[0.5,0.5],"imageCaption":null,"extension":"jpg","mimeType":"image/jpeg","assetLottieRatio":null},{"id":"2818","kind":"image","url":"https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/www-assets.legatum.com/assets/portfolio/Legatum-Luminos_Fund-C03.jpg","title":"Legatum Luminos Fund C03","width":1920,"height":1920,"focalPoint":[0.5,0.5],"imageCaption":null,"extension":"jpg","mimeType":"image/jpeg","assetLottieRatio":null}]},{"id":"3226","typeHandle":"text","heading":"Approach","text":"<p>The Luminos Fund mobilises resources from a broad range of investors to deliver the Second Chance programme in areas where there are a large number of out-of-school children.

The Fund also ensures that its classes are kept small and that continuous assessment is paired with routine feedback to make sure that all children are aware of their own learning progress. </p>\n<p>The teachers in each classroom are local young adults, who have been taught how to deliver the programme, and importantly, these local implementers of the programme understand the needs of those around them and are passionate about creating change in their communities.</p>\n<p>In 2017, the Luminos Fund launched a programme specifically designed to help refugee children in Lebanon.
